I use a 15.6 lcd monitor from zeuslap connected via hdmi to my raspberry pi 3b+
At 1080p I have no issue on power usage
(I also run an ambilight clone on it, for more detail see https://github.com/hyperion-project/HyperBian )

For the monitor stand I also use 3d printed stand they are on my thingiverse:
